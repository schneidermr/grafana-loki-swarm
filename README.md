# grafana-loki-swarm

Grafana Loki minimal setup for Docker Swarm

# Steps to Use Docker Compose File with Docker Swarm:

1. Initialize Docker Swarm

   Before deploying the stack to Docker Swarm, ensure that Docker Swarm is initialized. If you are using a single node (your local machine), you can initialize it using:
   ```bash
   docker swarm init
   ```
   If you have multiple nodes, Docker will provide you with a docker swarm join command to run on worker nodes.
2. Config files:

   Ensure that the configuration files specified under configs is available in Docker. As they are marked as external, you need to create them in Docker before deploying the stack:

   ```bash
   docker config create loki_config ./loki-config.yaml
   docker config create promtail_config ./promtail-config.yaml
   ```
   
3. Deploying the Stack

   Deploy the stack using docker stack deploy. 

   ```bash
   docker stack deploy -c grafana-loki-stack.yml my-stack
   ```

   Replace `my-stack` with the name you'd like to give to your stack.

4. Viewing Services

   To view the services running in your stack:

   ```bash
   docker stack services my-stack
   ```

5. Accessing Grafana

   Once deployed, you should be able to access Grafana on http://localhost:3000 (or using your Docker nodeâ€™s IP address).

6. Removing the Stack

   When you want to remove the stack:

   ```bash
   docker stack rm my-stack
   ```

7. Removing Configs

   If you want to remove the configuration, after removing the stack:

   ```bash
   docker config rm loki_config
   ```

Notes:

- Ensure Docker is running in swarm mode and your node is active.
- Ensure that all path references and external configurations are available and accurate.
- Always validate the configuration file using docker-compose config to avoid runtime issues.
- Monitor logs for loki and grafana services to troubleshoot any issues during runtime.

With these steps, your services defined in the Docker Compose file should be deployed and managed by Docker Swarm.
